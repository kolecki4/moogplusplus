 starting wavelength: 
 ending wavelength: 
replacing log(gf) from good list:   4742.541      27.0
 add in molecular lines (y/n)? 
 add Kurucz hfs for Fe-group lines without recent
 lab studies, [Sc I, Sc II, & Cu I] (y/n)? 
adding new line with hfs/iso components:   4742.528      27.0
 DONE!  CHECK THE LINE LIST CAREFULLY!
